# Personalized Annual Report Sample

I created this project inspired by the popular Net Music Annual Report. Using React.js as the framework, I built a personalized webpage to showcase interactive and visually engaging content. This project serves as a learning journey for me to explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all of which are completely new to me.

To make the project more dynamic and visually appealing, I used Procreate to design custom GIF animations. Additionally, I use R (especially Jieba NLP package) to analyze WeChat chat history data, integrating the insights into the project. These tools allowed me to combine creativity with technical problem-solving, making the development process both rewarding and enjoyable.   

年末亦是岁末，祝你生日快乐！
